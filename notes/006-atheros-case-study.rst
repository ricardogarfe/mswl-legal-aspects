Conclusión
===========

Theo the Raadt
===============

No se puede cambiar una licencia a la ligera, un cambio de BSD a GPL decidiendo o estipulando el nivel de modificación de una manera muy personal ya que hipotecas el código relicenciado a futuras modificaciones o aportes por parte de la comunidad.

Sobre Eben Moglen afirma que: "Perhaps the internationally based developers should rethink their
approach of taking advice from a US-based lawyer who apparently knows
nothing about the Berne Convention."

  "we wish to secure as much of the work done to adapt Reyk's
    code for use with the Linux kernel as the authors will
    permit, [...]"

I don't think Eben wanted to say that.  In copyright law, the word
"adapt" has a very clear meaning.


The first advice
-----------------

replacing Reyk's ISC license with the GPL around large parts of Reyk's code in various repositories 

Our developers have cloned those public/published repositories, though
some of them have now been taken offline by the developers who
operated them.

The second advice
------------------

that a GPL can be wrapped around another author's work.

The third advice
-----------------

The Linville repository replaced Jiri's repository (which Jiri disconnected), and all of Reyk's original work now appeared with only an ISC license as Reyk had it.  In this case Nick and Jiri have been added as co-owners of the copyright, though.

Conclusion
-----------

violated the law _3 times_ under advice from a ex-FSF laywer

Stallman: "The FSF is not involved in this dispute."

Summary
--------

The Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC) carried out an exhaustive, detailed, diachronic review of the Linux ath5k driver (“ath5k-driver”). SFLC has determined that the changes made by the Madwifi and Linux Wireless developers to generate ath5k-driver constitute copyrightable work derived from the original ar5k sources. In addition, SFLC has determined that the various branches of the code hosted currently by Madwifi on its madwifi-old-openhal branch (“madwifi-old-openhal”) and its ath5k branch (“ath5k-branch”) also constitute copyrightable derivatives of ar5k.

Propone que como muestra el correo de Raadt:


Final
======


Desarrolladores de drivers wifi para linux siguiendo los consejos de SFLC licencian el código GPL para una mejor integración en Linux.

madwifi - repositorio licenciado con ISC

OpenBSD (theo de Raadt) - No pueden aplicar las mejoras y pierden funcionalidades sin poder unificar y de esta forma crear bifurcaciones.
