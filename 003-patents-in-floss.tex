\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Traditionally, software patents have been considered harmful for free/open source software. Why?}\\

	Software patents, or patents applied to software are harmful for free/open source software because the meaning of life of a patent is to prevent anyone from using the software without consent so it has to compensate the author for use by the free software that would be considered a penalty the dissemination of knowledge so that patents are beyond all free software because they prevent free use.\\

	Patents on software as we saw in class not make much sense since they are subject to a life expectancy of 20 years so that 20 years in the software world are too many and the patent upon reaching adulthood would be obsolete, even before.

	\item \textbf{Find the different techniques and strategies that free software community have implemented (via FLOSS licenses and others) for defending against patents}.\\

	The FLOSS community is defined through a pathway different licenses to facilitate the use of patents if they exist within the incorporated software.\\

	To facilitate use of such patents have the Apache license. This license requires that facilitates the use of patents if they are contained in the code so that the user does not worry about them and can continue working with FLOSS code.
